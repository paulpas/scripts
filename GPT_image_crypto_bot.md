Bitcoin Candlestick Pattern Recognition Using Screenshots

1. Data Collection

Screenshots of Candlestick Charts

Collect a large dataset of Bitcoin candlestick chart screenshots.

Label each image with the expected price movement:

Up: Price expected to increase.

Down: Price expected to decrease.

Neutral: No significant movement.



Data Sources

Use tools like TradingView to generate and save candlestick charts.

Automate the screenshot process using Python and libraries like Selenium or PyAutoGUI.



---

2. Preprocessing the Screenshots

Steps

1. Resize Images: Standardize the size (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256 pixels) to ensure consistent input.


2. Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale if color isn't essential (reduces computation).


3. Normalize Pixel Values: Scale pixel values between 0 and 1 for better model convergence.


4. Data Augmentation: Add variations to the dataset:

Rotate, crop, zoom, or slightly alter brightness/contrast to simulate different chart styles.




Example Preprocessing Code

import cv2
import os
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image_path, target_size=(128, 128)):
    """Load, resize, and normalize an image."""
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    img = cv2.resize(img, target_size)
    img = img / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    return img

# Preprocess all images in a folder
data_dir = 'path/to/screenshots'
processed_images = []
labels = []  # E.g., 1 for "Up", 0 for "Down"

for file_name in os.listdir(data_dir):
    img_path = os.path.join(data_dir, file_name)
    label = 1 if 'up' in file_name else 0  # Simple label extraction
    processed_images.append(preprocess_image(img_path))
    labels.append(label)

processed_images = np.array(processed_images)
labels = np.array(labels)


---

3. Feature Extraction

Using CNNs to Automatically Learn Patterns

Candlestick patterns like doji, hammer, or engulfing patterns are visual features. CNNs are ideal for detecting these.

Example CNN Model

from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Build a CNN
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(processed_images, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)


---

4. Advanced: Pattern Detection and Custom Features

Predefine Known Patterns

Extract features related to candlestick shapes, such as:

Shadow ratio: Proportion of wick to body.

Body direction: Upward (green) or downward (red).

Patterns: Combine multiple candles to identify head-and-shoulders, triangles, etc.


Code Example for Pattern Features

def extract_candlestick_features(image):
    """Extract custom candlestick pattern features."""
    # Placeholder for actual feature extraction logic
    # Example: Calculate pixel intensity distributions
    vertical_sums = np.sum(image, axis=0)
    horizontal_sums = np.sum(image, axis=1)
    return np.concatenate([vertical_sums, horizontal_sums])

# Apply feature extraction
features = np.array([extract_candlestick_features(img) for img in processed_images])

Combine these features with deep learning or classical machine learning models like Random Forest or SVM.


---

5. Predicting Price Movement

Prediction Code

# Load a new candlestick screenshot
new_image = preprocess_image('path/to/new_screenshot.jpg')
new_image = np.expand_dims(new_image, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(new_image)
if prediction[0] > 0.5:
    print("Price likely to go up!")
else:
    print("Price likely to go down!")


---

6. Metrics and Evaluation

Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

Analyze misclassified images to understand model limitations and refine the dataset.



---

7. Automation and Real-Time Analysis

Automate Screenshot Collection

Use a script to capture candlestick charts periodically:

import pyautogui

# Capture screenshot
screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
screenshot.save('path/to/save/candlestick.png')

Real-Time Prediction

Feed screenshots into the trained model for live predictions:

Integrate with a trading bot for automated decision-making.

Set thresholds for "confidence" before making trade decisions.



---

Let me know if you’d like help setting up the dataset, training the model, or refining specific features for candlestick patterns!


Great! Let’s break this down into steps for building an application to analyze Bitcoin candlestick data and recognize patterns. I'll provide examples and detailed implementation for each component.


---

Application Outline

1. Frontend: User interface to upload candlestick screenshots and display predictions.


2. Backend: Processes the uploaded images and runs the model for predictions.


3. Machine Learning Model: Trained model to recognize patterns and predict price movements.


4. Automation (Optional): Automatically fetch screenshots from a source (like TradingView) at intervals.




---

1. Frontend Implementation

We’ll use a framework like Streamlit for simplicity, as it supports image uploads and displaying predictions.

Example Code (Frontend)

import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/your_model.h5')

def preprocess_image(image):
    """Preprocess the uploaded image for model prediction."""
    image = image.resize((128, 128))  # Resize to model's input size
    image = np.array(image.convert('L')) / 255.0  # Grayscale and normalize
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=(0, -1))  # Add batch and channel dimensions
    return image

# Streamlit app
st.title("Bitcoin Candlestick Pattern Recognition")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a candlestick screenshot", type=["jpg", "png"])

if uploaded_file:
    image = Image.open(uploaded_file)
    st.image(image, caption="Uploaded Screenshot", use_column_width=True)

    # Preprocess and predict
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image)
    prediction = model.predict(processed_image)

    if prediction[0] > 0.5:
        st.success("Prediction: Price likely to go UP!")
    else:
        st.error("Prediction: Price likely to go DOWN!")


---

2. Backend Implementation

For a more robust solution, use a backend framework like Flask or FastAPI.

Example Code (Backend)

from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()
model = load_model('path/to/your_model.h5')

def preprocess_image(image):
    """Preprocess image for model prediction."""
    image = image.resize((128, 128))
    image = np.array(image.convert('L')) / 255.0
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=(0, -1))
    return image

@app.post("/predict/")
async def predict(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    image = Image.open(file.file)
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image)
    prediction = model.predict(processed_image)
    result = "UP" if prediction[0] > 0.5 else "DOWN"
    return {"prediction": result}

# Run server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)


---

3. Training and Model Deployment

Use TensorFlow/Keras to train your model. Save the trained model for deployment using .save().

Saving and Loading the Model

# After training
model.save('path/to/your_model.h5')

# Load for prediction
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('path/to/your_model.h5')


---

4. Automating Screenshot Collection

Use Selenium or PyAutoGUI to capture candlestick chart screenshots periodically.

Example Screenshot Automation

import pyautogui
import time

def capture_screenshot(save_path):
    """Capture and save a screenshot."""
    screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    screenshot.save(save_path)

# Automate every 10 minutes
while True:
    capture_screenshot(f"screenshots/chart_{int(time.time())}.png")
    time.sleep(600)  # Wait 10 minutes


---

5. Combine Frontend and Backend

Deployment

Deploy the backend on a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

Use the frontend to call the backend API for predictions.


Example API Call in Frontend

import requests

# API endpoint
url = "http://your-backend-server.com/predict/"
files = {'file': open('path/to/screenshot.png', 'rb')}

# Make a prediction request
response = requests.post(url, files=files)
print(response.json())


---

6. Complete Workflow

1. Frontend: Users upload candlestick screenshots.


2. Backend: Processes the image and returns predictions.


3. Automation: Optional, periodically captures screenshots for real-time analysis.




---

Would you like me to help with a specific part of the application (e.g., training the model, setting up the backend, or building the frontend)?
To automate the process of analyzing 1-hour candlestick data from a CSV file, rendering it as an image, and processing it for predictions, we can use the following approach:


---

1. Workflow

1. Read the CSV File: Extract 1-hour candlestick data (Open, High, Low, Close).


2. Render the Chart: Use Matplotlib to generate a candlestick chart.


3. Save the Chart as an Image: Save it as an image for further processing.


4. Process and Predict: Use the saved image as input to the prediction model.




---

2. Example Implementation

Read and Render Candlestick Data

We’ll use Pandas to read the CSV and Matplotlib (along with mplfinance) to create candlestick charts.

CSV File Format

The CSV should have columns like:

Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
2024-11-24 00:00,37300,37500,37100,37400,1200
2024-11-24 01:00,37400,37600,37200,37550,1100
...

Code to Render Chart

import pandas as pd
import mplfinance as mpf

def render_candlestick_chart(csv_path, save_path):
    """Generate and save a candlestick chart from CSV data."""
    # Load CSV
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
    df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
    
    # Ensure required columns exist
    df = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']]
    
    # Generate candlestick chart
    mpf.plot(df, type='candle', style='charles', savefig=save_path)

# Example usage
csv_file = 'path/to/1_hour_data.csv'
output_image = 'candlestick_chart.png'
render_candlestick_chart(csv_file, output_image)


---

3. Automating the Prediction

Once the chart is generated, process it using your trained model.

Prediction Code

from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/your_model.h5')

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    """Preprocess the candlestick chart image for prediction."""
    img = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')  # Grayscale
    img = img.resize((128, 128))  # Resize to model's input size
    img = np.array(img) / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=(0, -1))  # Add batch and channel dimensions
    return img

def predict_candlestick(image_path):
    """Predict the price movement based on the candlestick chart."""
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image_path)
    prediction = model.predict(processed_image)
    return "UP" if prediction[0] > 0.5 else "DOWN"

# Example usage
image_path = 'candlestick_chart.png'
prediction = predict_candlestick(image_path)
print(f"Prediction: Price likely to go {prediction}")


---

4. Frontend Automation

Integrating with Streamlit

Automatically process the CSV file, render the chart, and display the prediction.

import streamlit as st

st.title("Bitcoin Candlestick Pattern Recognition")

# Upload CSV file
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload 1-hour candlestick data (CSV)", type=["csv"])

if uploaded_file:
    # Render candlestick chart
    chart_path = "candlestick_chart.png"
    render_candlestick_chart(uploaded_file, chart_path)
    st.image(chart_path, caption="Generated Candlestick Chart", use_column_width=True)

    # Predict price movement
    prediction = predict_candlestick(chart_path)
    st.write(f"Prediction: Price likely to go **{prediction}**")


---

5. Automating Real-Time Data

If you want this process to run continuously:

1. Integrate with an API like Binance or Coinbase to fetch live 1-hour candlestick data.


2. Store the data in CSV format.


3. Render and analyze periodically.



Example of Fetching Live Data

import requests

def fetch_live_data():
    """Fetch 1-hour candlestick data using Binance API."""
    url = "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines"
    params = {"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "interval": "1h", "limit": 100}
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Format as a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[
        "OpenTime", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume", 
        "CloseTime", "QuoteAssetVolume", "NumberOfTrades", 
        "TakerBuyBase", "TakerBuyQuote", "Ignore"
    ])
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['OpenTime'], unit='ms')
    df = df[['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
    return df

# Save to CSV
live_data = fetch_live_data()
live_data.to_csv("live_data.csv", index=False)


---

6. Full Automation Workflow

1. Fetch live data periodically and save it as a CSV.


2. Render the candlestick chart from the CSV.


3. Predict price movement based on the rendered chart.


4. Display the results or trigger actions based on predictions.




---

Would you like help integrating the live data fetching, or are there other features you’d like in the application?

Here’s how you can fetch 1-hour candlestick data from the KuCoin exchange using their API.


---

KuCoin API for Candlestick Data

KuCoin provides an API endpoint for fetching market candlestick data. We’ll use the /api/v1/market/candles endpoint.

API Details

Endpoint: https://api.kucoin.com/api/v1/market/candles

Parameters:

type: Interval (e.g., 1hour for 1-hour candlesticks).

symbol: Trading pair (e.g., BTC-USDT).

startAt: Start time in seconds (UNIX timestamp).

endAt: End time in seconds (UNIX timestamp).




---

Code to Fetch Data

Example Python Code

import requests
import pandas as pd
import time

def fetch_kucoin_data(symbol="BTC-USDT", interval="1hour", limit=100):
    """Fetch 1-hour candlestick data from KuCoin API."""
    base_url = "https://api.kucoin.com/api/v1/market/candles"
    end_time = int(time.time())  # Current time in UNIX
    start_time = end_time - (3600 * limit)  # Limit candles to the last N hours

    params = {
        "type": interval,
        "symbol": symbol,
        "startAt": start_time,
        "endAt": end_time
    }
    
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()['data']
        # Convert to DataFrame
        df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[
            "Time", "Open", "Close", "High", "Low", "Volume", "Turnover"
        ])
        df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'], unit='s')  # Convert UNIX to datetime
        return df
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Error fetching data: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Fetch and save to CSV
kucoin_data = fetch_kucoin_data()
kucoin_data.to_csv("kucoin_candlesticks.csv", index=False)
print(kucoin_data.head())


---

Parameters You Can Adjust

symbol: Replace BTC-USDT with another pair (e.g., ETH-USDT).

interval: Change to 1min, 15min, 4hour, etc., based on your needs.

limit: Adjust the number of candlesticks fetched by modifying the time range.



---

Integrating With Your Application

1. Use this function to fetch live candlestick data.


2. Save the data as a CSV file.


3. Use the earlier code to render charts and predict price movements.



Example Integration

# Fetch live data
live_data = fetch_kucoin_data()

# Save to CSV for processing
csv_path = "kucoin_candlesticks.csv"
live_data.to_csv(csv_path, index=False)

# Render chart and predict
output_chart = "candlestick_chart.png"
render_candlestick_chart(csv_path, output_chart)
prediction = predict_candlestick(output_chart)
print(f"Prediction: Price likely to go {prediction}")


---

Would you like to add features like scheduling periodic data fetching or storing historical data?


Here’s how to set up a system for periodic data fetching, processing, and prediction based on historical patterns:


---

1. Periodic Data Fetching

Use Python's schedule or APScheduler module to fetch data at regular intervals (e.g., every hour).

Code for Periodic Fetching

import schedule
import time
import pandas as pd

# Function to fetch and append data
def fetch_and_save_kucoin_data(csv_path="kucoin_historical.csv"):
    """Fetch data from KuCoin and append to a CSV."""
    try:
        # Fetch latest data
        new_data = fetch_kucoin_data()
        
        # Load existing data if available
        try:
            existing_data = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            existing_data = pd.DataFrame()

        # Combine and save
        combined_data = pd.concat([existing_data, new_data]).drop_duplicates(subset="Time")
        combined_data.to_csv(csv_path, index=False)
        print("Data fetched and saved successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during fetch: {e}")

# Schedule to run every hour
schedule.every(1).hour.do(fetch_and_save_kucoin_data)

print("Starting periodic fetching...")
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)


---

2. Prediction Based on Historical Data

Enhance the ML model to account for historical trends by combining recent candlesticks and their predictions.

Process Historical Data

Create features like:

Moving Averages: 10-hour, 20-hour.

Price Changes: Compare closing prices.

Volume Changes: Measure trading activity.


Example Code

def create_features(df):
    """Generate features from historical candlestick data."""
    df['Close'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Close'])
    df['Volume'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Volume'])

    # Moving averages
    df['MA_10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
    df['MA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

    # Price changes
    df['Price_Change'] = df['Close'].pct_change()

    # Volume changes
    df['Volume_Change'] = df['Volume'].pct_change()

    df.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Handle NaN values
    return df

# Process fetched data
historical_data = pd.read_csv("kucoin_historical.csv")
processed_data = create_features(historical_data)
processed_data.to_csv("processed_historical.csv", index=False)


---

3. Model for Predicting Based on History

Input: Latest candlestick and its historical features.

Output: Predicted price direction (UP/DOWN).


Example Model Training

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Prepare data
X = processed_data[['Close', 'MA_10', 'MA_20', 'Price_Change', 'Volume_Change']]
y = (processed_data['Close'].shift(-1) > processed_data['Close']).astype(int)  # 1 if price goes up

# Split into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X[:-1], y[:-1], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)}")

# Save model
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "historical_model.pkl")


---

4. Real-Time Prediction Integration

Load the trained model and use it for predictions.

Code to Predict Real-Time Movements

import joblib

# Load trained model
historical_model = joblib.load("historical_model.pkl")

def predict_with_history(latest_csv):
    """Predict price movement using historical data."""
    latest_data = pd.read_csv(latest_csv)
    latest_data = create_features(latest_data)

    # Use the most recent data point for prediction
    latest_features = latest_data[['Close', 'MA_10', 'MA_20', 'Price_Change', 'Volume_Change']].iloc[-1:]
    prediction = historical_model.predict(latest_features)
    return "UP" if prediction[0] == 1 else "DOWN"

# Example usage
latest_prediction = predict_with_history("kucoin_historical.csv")
print(f"Prediction based on history: Price likely to go {latest_prediction}")


---

5. Deploying the Application

Full Workflow:

1. Fetch Data Periodically:

Schedule regular updates to append new data to the historical dataset.



2. Process Features:

Extract features like moving averages and price changes for training/prediction.



3. Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to predict price movements.



4. Trigger Alerts or Actions:

Send notifications or execute trades based on predictions.




Would you like help setting up notifications, deploying this system to the cloud, or optimizing the model?


Here’s how to implement a system that recognizes 1% upward trends for entry signals, provides exit signals based on profit or reversal, and manages risk by minimizing losses:


---

1. Identifying Entry Points

The system will monitor the candlestick data and notify you when the price increases by more than 1% in a predictable pattern.

Code for Entry Signal

def detect_entry_signal(data):
    """
    Detect patterns where the price goes up by more than 1% for a buy signal.
    """
    # Calculate percentage change
    data['Price_Change'] = data['Close'].pct_change()

    # Detect upward movement greater than 1%
    entry_signal = data['Price_Change'] > 0.01

    # Find the latest signal
    if entry_signal.iloc[-1]:
        return True, data.iloc[-1]['Close']
    return False, None

# Example usage
latest_data = pd.read_csv("kucoin_historical.csv")
entry_signal, entry_price = detect_entry_signal(latest_data)
if entry_signal:
    print(f"Buy signal detected at price: {entry_price}")


---

2. Identifying Exit Points

Two conditions for exit:

1. Profit Exit: Exit when the price has risen by more than 1% since purchase.


2. Stop Loss: Exit if the price drops below a certain threshold to minimize loss.



Code for Exit Signal

def detect_exit_signal(data, entry_price):
    """
    Detect when to exit the trade:
    1. Profit is above 1% and no further gains are expected.
    2. Price drops below a loss threshold.
    """
    # Calculate percentage change from entry price
    current_price = data.iloc[-1]['Close']
    profit_change = (current_price - entry_price) / entry_price

    # Exit conditions
    if profit_change > 0.01:
        # Check if the trend is reversing
        if data['Price_Change'].iloc[-1] < 0:  # Trend reversal
            return "Exit for profit", current_price
    elif profit_change < -0.01:  # Loss threshold
        return "Exit to minimize loss", current_price

    return None, current_price

# Example usage
exit_reason, current_price = detect_exit_signal(latest_data, entry_price)
if exit_reason:
    print(f"{exit_reason} at price: {current_price}")


---

3. Real-Time Notifications

Use smtplib for email or webhooks for notifications (e.g., Slack, Telegram).

Example Notification with Email

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_notification(subject, message, to_email):
    """Send email notifications."""
    from_email = "your_email@example.com"
    from_password = "your_password"

    msg = MIMEText(message)
    msg["Subject"] = subject
    msg["From"] = from_email
    msg["To"] = to_email

    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(from_email, from_password)
        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())

# Example usage
send_notification(
    "Trade Alert",
    f"{exit_reason} at price: {current_price}",
    "your_email@example.com"
)


---

4. Full Workflow Integration

Combine entry and exit detection with live data fetching for a fully automated system.

Complete Example

def trade_strategy():
    """
    Run the trading strategy:
    1. Detect entry signals.
    2. Track trade and detect exit signals.
    """
    historical_data = pd.read_csv("kucoin_historical.csv")
    entry_signal, entry_price = detect_entry_signal(historical_data)

    if entry_signal:
        print(f"Buy signal detected at price: {entry_price}")
        send_notification("Buy Signal", f"Buy at price: {entry_price}", "your_email@example.com")

        # Monitor for exit
        while True:
            latest_data = fetch_kucoin_data()
            exit_reason, current_price = detect_exit_signal(latest_data, entry_price)

            if exit_reason:

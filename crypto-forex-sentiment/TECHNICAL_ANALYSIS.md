The data you've shared appears to be time series data that consists of multiple readings over a period, recorded at hourly intervals (as indicated by the timestamps in milliseconds). Each sub-array within your list contains specific information:

1. **Timestamp**: The first entry is an epoch timestamp indicating when the observation or reading was made.

2. **Open Price**: This is likely the opening price for a certain asset (e.g., stock, commodity) at that particular time. 

3. **High Price**: The highest recorded price during this period.

4. **Low Price**: The lowest recorded price during this period.

5. **Close Price**: The closing price of the asset at the end of the specified interval.

6. **Volume (or another metric)**: This represents additional data associated with each time point, such as trading volume or some other relevant numeric measurement tied to market activity.

Here's a simple interpretation:

1. At `1747752840000` (Unix timestamp), an observation records:
   - Open price = 104657.8
   - High price = 104685.9 
   - Low price = 104641.8 
   - Close price = 104671.9
   - Additional metric (volume) = 0.66722339

2. The data continues across different timestamps, providing a comprehensive log of market behavior over time.

To analyze this data further:
- **Trend Analysis**: Observe the opening and closing prices relative to high and low for daily or specific interval trends.
- **Volatility**: Measure by the difference between high and low within each interval.
- **Volume Changes**: Analyze any notable patterns in associated volumes (if applicable), as they might indicate market sentiment.

This data could be used to predict future price movements, assess past performance, or back-test trading strategies. If more detailed analysis is needed, importing this data into a tool like Excel, Python (with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries), or R would be beneficial for visualization and advanced statistical computation..

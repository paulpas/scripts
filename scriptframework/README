This describes the method of how we manage custom scripts for crontab entries or other important maintenance items.



1) The host where all scripts need to be located are:

nagios:/root/scripts/bin/

1a) Scripts can be developed on their destination host, they will removed if they are not added to the script host.  Design your scripts in /tmp or some safe directory!

1b) /root/scripts/sbin/ can be used for utility scripts.  For example, frequently used scripts to modify files on multiple servers


2) Once you put your script in there you can enable it by a symbolic link to /root/scripts/scripts-enabled/ by using the supplied script:

ex: /root/scripts/bin/enablescript.sh <script name>


3) In your crontab entries you will add it similar as follows as applicable:

0 * * * * /root/scripts/scripts-enabled/<script name>


4) To disable the script do the following command:

/root/scripts/bin/disablescript.sh <script name>

YOU MUST ONLY RUN SCRIPTS IN scripts-enabled TO KEEP solidarity!!!



Functions required:

5) Must specifiy which host and user it can run as, and env variables.

Ex:  root / imgrzp01


# The only host this script can run on
hostallow="372654-imgrzp01"

# Ensure the script runs on imgrzp01 as root only.
if [[ `whoami` != root ]] || [[ `hostname -s` != $hostallow ]]
then
        echo "$0 needs to be run as root and on the host $targethost."
        echo "Script is being run as `whoami`@`hostname -s`.  Exiting."
        rm -f $pidfile
        exit 1
fi


6) ENV variables needed in each script

. /root/scripts/etc/env
